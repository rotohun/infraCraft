# üß± InfraCraft: Mastering Backend, DevOps, AI & Big Data Infrastructure

**From building APIs to deploying intelligent, data-driven systems at scale**

InfraCraft is a 4-month, project-based engineering bootcamp designed to teach you how to design, build, deploy, and manage world-class backend applications, cloud infrastructure, and AI/data pipelines.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This curriculum is ideal for self-taught engineers, indie hackers, or early-stage builders who want to:

- Go from basic backend experience to full-scale deployments
- Learn DevOps, networking, container orchestration, and observability
- Build and serve AI features and data products
- Master both streaming and batch Big Data systems

You will build real infrastructure and deploy working products, with Docker, FastAPI, CI/CD, Terraform, K8s, Kafka, and more.

Each module culminates in a deployable, documented project. By the end of the course, you'll have:

### ‚úÖ **World-Class Backend Stack**
- Authenticated FastAPI or Node API
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker Compose
- Production-ready container setup with Nginx or Traefik

### ‚úÖ **CI/CD Pipeline**
- Automated build/test/deploy with GitHub Actions
- Push to GitHub Container Registry
- Deploy to VPS or cloud with Terraform

### ‚úÖ **AI Q&A System**
- Inference server running local or remote LLMs
- Upload + process documents, extract context
- Vector search with semantic recall (Weaviate)

### ‚úÖ **Big Data Pipeline**
- Kafka pipeline for real-time ingestion
