# 🌐 Web Server & Reverse Proxy

## ✅ Goal
Configure and optimize Nginx/Traefik as a reverse proxy and load balancer for the backend services.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Nginx/Traefik** | High-performance web server and reverse proxy |
| **Let's Encrypt** | Automated SSL/TLS certificate management |
| **Certbot** | SSL certificate automation tool |
| **OpenSSL** | SSL/TLS toolkit for certificate management |
| **ModSecurity** | Web application firewall (WAF) |

## 🎓 Real-World Importance
A properly configured web server is crucial for security, performance, and reliability. It handles SSL termination, load balancing, and protects backend services from direct exposure to the internet.

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Reverse proxy configuration
- SSL/TLS setup with automatic renewal
- Load balancing configuration
- Security headers and WAF rules
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Static file serving
- Gzip compression
