# ⚡ Caching Layer

## ✅ Goal
Implement an efficient caching system using Redis to improve application performance and reduce database load.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Redis** | In-memory data structure store for caching and real-time features |
| **Redis Sentinel** | High availability and failover management |
| **Redis Commander** | Web-based Redis management interface |
| **Redis Stack** | Enhanced Redis with search and JSON capabilities |
| **RedisInsight** | GUI for Redis monitoring and debugging |

## 🎓 Real-World Importance
Caching is essential for high-performance applications, reducing latency and database load. Understanding caching strategies and patterns is crucial for building scalable systems that can handle high traffic.

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Cache layer integration with the API
- Caching strategies (write-through, write-behind)
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Rate limiting implementation
- Session management
- Real-time features using Redis pub/sub
