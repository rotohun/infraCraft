# 🚀 Backend API Development

## ✅ Goal
Build a production-grade RESTful API using FastAPI/Node.js that follows best practices for scalability, security, and maintainability.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **FastAPI/Node.js** | Modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with automatic OpenAPI documentation |
| **Docker** | Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments |
| **Pydantic/TypeScript** | Data validation and type safety for request/response handling |
| **JWT/OAuth2** | Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms |
| **Swagger/OpenAPI** | Interactive API documentation and testing interface |

## 🎓 Real-World Importance
Backend APIs are the foundation of modern applications, serving as the interface between frontend clients and business logic. A well-designed API enables scalability, maintainability, and seamless integration with other services.

## 🛠️ Implementation
- RESTful API endpoints with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Authentication and authorization system
- Input validation and error handling
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Unit and integration tests
- Docker containerization
