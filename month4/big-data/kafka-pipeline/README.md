# 🔄 Streaming Data Pipeline

## ✅ Goal
Build a robust real-time data streaming pipeline using Kafka/Redpanda for high-throughput, fault-tolerant data processing.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Kafka/Redpanda** | Distributed streaming platform |
| **Kafka Connect** | Data import/export connectors |
| **Kafka Streams** | Stream processing library |
| **Schema Registry** | Schema management and evolution |
| **Kafka UI** | Monitoring and management interface |

## 🎓 Real-World Importance
Streaming data pipelines are essential for real-time analytics, event-driven architectures, and building responsive data-driven applications.

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Topic design and partitioning
- Producer/consumer applications
- Stream processing jobs
- Data transformation pipelines
- Monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery
