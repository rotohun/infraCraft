# 📊 Observability Stack

## ✅ Goal
Set up a comprehensive monitoring and observability stack using Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki for system visibility and alerting.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Grafana** | Metrics visualization and dashboarding |
| **Prometheus** | Metrics collection and storage |
| **Loki** | Log aggregation and querying |
| **AlertManager** | Alert routing and notification |
| **Node Exporter** | System metrics collection |

## 🎓 Real-World Importance
Observability is crucial for maintaining system health, detecting issues early, and understanding system behavior in production environments.

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Metrics collection and storage
- Custom dashboards and visualizations
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Alert rules and notifications
- Service level objectives (SLOs)
- Performance monitoring
