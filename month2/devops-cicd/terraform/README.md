# 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code

## ✅ Goal
Define and manage cloud infrastructure using Terraform, enabling reproducible and version-controlled infrastructure deployments.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Terraform** | Infrastructure as Code tool for cloud resource management |
| **Terraform Cloud** | Remote state management and team collaboration |
| **Terragrunt** | DRY configuration for Terraform modules |
| **Terraform Modules** | Reusable infrastructure components |
| **Terraform Workspaces** | Environment isolation and management |

## 🎓 Real-World Importance
Infrastructure as Code is essential for modern DevOps practices, enabling consistent, reproducible, and auditable infrastructure deployments across environments.

## 🛠️ Implementation
- Cloud provider configuration (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Network infrastructure setup
- Compute resources provisioning
- Database and storage configuration
- Security groups and IAM policies
- Environment-specific configurations
